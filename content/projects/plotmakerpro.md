### Background

One of the things I like about AI is not having to bother about sintax of things that you don't use that often. For me, data visualization is one of those things. I love working with data, but I hate having to deal with tools that are not user friendly when it comes to visualizing it. Also enabling non-technical users to create their own charts with natural language is something I find really exciting.

## Subjects to explore

- Prompting techniques
- Multi-modal inputs
- Dynamic UIs

### Quick overview

This is an attempt to create a tool that would allow users to create charts for their data in a chat-like interface. The idea is to let the user create a chart with natural language by asking the AI to generate a chart for them. The AI will take the input and generate a chart for the user. Users will be able to see and customize the generated chart.

### To-Do

- TBD
