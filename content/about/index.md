Hi, I'm **Fernando** ;)

I'm currently working as data scientist. I love building data apps and I have been working for the last 5 years applying ML models to a buch of different business problems.

What I am currently working with:

- NLP: keyword search + word embeddings + hierachical clustering
- A bunch o tabular models (XGBoost ftw!)
- LLM funny experiments (calling APIs ðŸ˜Ž)
