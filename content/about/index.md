Hi, I'm Fernando ;)

I'm a data scientist working at LawDepot.com. I love building things with code and even after 8+ years doing it, I still find it magical to deploy a website with a couple of files and a simple server.

Fun Facts:

- I am a huge e-sports fan.
- I can't drive without music on (\m/).
- I fight my lawn every spring but can't make it look good (still trying..).
