### The start and motivations

It's AI season, folks! ðŸš€

Jumping on this bandwagon, I decided to build [BanQstream](www.banqstream.com). This is an attempt to create a finance/budgeting assistant - something I wanted for myself to get rid (finally) of my spreadsheets. My primary aim this season? Dive deep into LLMs and see what they've got to offer.

This is what [BanQstream](www.banqstream.com) can do right now:

- Parse the data from any bank account or credit card you own.
  - No connections required > A nod to privacy.
- Standardize names for similar transactions, making your financial overview a breeze.
- Suggest spending categories for your transactions.
- Ask questions about your finances! Fetch answers and visual breakdowns of all your transactions stored on **BanQstream**.

### Quick demo on current functionalities

### Next Steps

TThis project is my playground to experiment with LLM applications across various challenges. Currently, I'm intrigued by:

- Basic LLM functionalities.
- Embedding + ANN + clustering.
- LLM fine-tuning.

And here are the possible next steps for this project (although, a heads up, not all may see the light of day):

- Design a dedicated UI, possibly with fastAPI and React.
- Experiment with fine-tuned models for the AI assistant.
- Enhance the UI with added functionalities for editing transactions.
