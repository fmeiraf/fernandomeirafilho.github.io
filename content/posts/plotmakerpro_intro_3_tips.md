introduction: what have I been doing since Feb >> title is bad, why would that be valuable for other people? >> Don't repeat what I did >> How would I accelerate creating nice AI apps based on my learnings

Title: Don't repeat my mistakes: 4 ways to accelerate getting results with your AI apps ((make it more catchy as less sale: 4 learnings I had myself so you don't screw over)

my target: companies and users trying to apply AI on their own problems.

-- Hook: how is the most common problem people have when creating web apps

See if you relate to this sequence of facts:

**Honey Moon**

1. You hear a friend or colleague's recurring problem.
2. Excited, you realize LLMs can solve it.
3. Your first prompt/response test is a success â€” proof of concept achieved!
4. FOMO drives you to build an app, setting up backend and UI basics.

**Negation**

5. You run a couple of simple tests.
6. Some results are questionable, but you ignore them.
7. Stay positive.

**Delusion**

8. Friends share more use cases.
9. Anxiety hits as low-quality responses appear.
10. Overfitting: you overload prompts with instructions.
11. It works, but now some simple use cases start to look really bad.
    (Possible infinite loop on 10 and 11)
12. More use cases make it feel like a gamble, with mostly losses.
13. You give up.
14. You conclude that AI isn't good yet.
    **End.**

-- What I was doing and how I got to my conclusions
Well, as the title says I have been there before. Since Feb, while learning how to be a dad for the first time, I started my journey on the steps above when I decided to build <Link>. After months of trying to squeeze in some hours per week on building it, I found myself on this roller-coaster. And not only I had the same thing happening with other simpler use cases, but also had same feedback from some friends trying to use AI to build things. After some good months, I started seeing progress and learned some things that have been helping me to achieve better results - and better than that: having a good time building new software!

Hope this helps you too:

-- Learnings

- Using structured outputs is key in 99% of the time (I recommend instructor - thanks Jason Liu).
- Make your goal objective (even when it's not straightforward): you can use other LLMs for that.
- Single shot prompts provide amateur results: run more inference!
- Let it iterate (aka agents)
